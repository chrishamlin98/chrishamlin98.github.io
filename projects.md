## Swing GUI Log-In

> **Project Description:**  I designed this program for users to create user names and passwords in order to gain access to a database.  Further, it has been created using a model-view-controller (MVC) data structure and takes advantage of the use of database access objects (DAO) and a DAO Factory pattern in order to allow the integration of multiple database types.
