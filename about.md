# About Chris

![Profile Image]({{ site.url }}/{{ site.picture }})

<p>I am first and foremost a man of God whom loves his family with all of his heart.  My wife and I will be enjoying the entrance of our second child (a boy!) into the world as of April 2020.  We enjoy spending time as a family and live a humble life where family is always the first priority.</p>
